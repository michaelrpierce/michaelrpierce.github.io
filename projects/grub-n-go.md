# Grub-n-Go

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/grub-n-go-landing.png">

## Overview
Over the course of these last few months my team and I have developed a web application we call [Grub-N-Go](https://grub-n-go.github.io/).
The intention for Grub-n-Go was to provide students and faculty members located at University of Hawaii's Manoa campus
with a simple and easy to use service that allows them to search for places to eat. The website provides options for
vendors to sign up onto the website and make their menu options known to users of the service. Members can browse
vendors by food type, view all available vendors on the venues tab, or simply view the choices of the day as
provided by the vendors. Signed in members can also search for vendors that provide specific food types through the
filter page.

## Contributions and Experience
Building this application with my fellow team members allowed to me really see how far I've progressed with Software
Engineering over the course of the past semester. I entered the semester with very little experience with html and css,
and had yet to utilize github for version control. As the semester progressed I encountered many tools I would add to
my software engineering toolkit, from experience with javascript to knowledge of the meteor API. The scope of my work in
the project included creating and managing collections within the mongodb, writing server side meteor methods to manage
 publications, and creating pages such as Today's Menu. I felt I was able to properly utilize knowledge I've gained over
 the past semester in my ICS 314 Software Engineering class, and feel better prepared moving forward in my software
 engineering journey.

# ICS 111 Project

## Snake Game

<img class="../images/snake-game-screenshot.jpg">


This snake game was developed as a final project for my ICS 111 class at UH Manoa. The aim of the project was to
utilize techniques learned over the semester to create a small game project and demonstrate it in a youtube video.
During the project I learned about function and variable scope, as well as object inheritence. I enjoyed working on
the projects in this class because ever since I started learning how to program, designing video games has always 
interested me.

Before this class I had designed a simple ball bouncing game but I had always wanted to take on one of the classics
like tetris or pong, or snake. I decided the game logic was simple enough for my ability at the time and could
properly demonstrate my grasping on the intended topics of inheritence and scope. I am happy with how the game 
turned out even if the animation was choppy and the tail started to grow only once it reached the spot where the
apple was eaten (as shown in the video). I would likely change much of the design using what I know today.

Unfortunately due to a harddrive failure the source code is no longer available for this program. The program used
a class file EZ.java that was given to students to assist with drawing to a screen and handling input and sound.
The demonstrate video link can be found below, include segments of my code, however the rest of the code is lost.

##Javascript Impression##

First Impressions
My first introduction to a formal programming education was taught using the language c++. Coming from that you can 
probably undertstand why I was a little bit shaken by the way type inferencing works in javascript, among other things. 
When I was completing the FreeCodeCamp problems and reading the explanations everythingfelt very familiar to me. I knew
what variable declarations were, I knew how to write a for loop, I knew how to access array, I was familiar with the 
concept of object oriented design and,so on. It felt strange to me when I read the problem and wasn't instructed to 
declare the type in the variable declaration. My first impression was a bit of concern as to any issues that I would 
run into with the flexible variables.

##Flexibility##

After taking my first steps with the language I think I can say that I am starting to appreciate its flexibility.
Completing the in-class WODs and problems has shown me how the flexibility can actually be useful and save some
uneccesary complexity when creating functions. Being able to return multiple different types of variables from the same
function has proven itself to be useful to me in situations, even if it does feel unsafe and foreign when compared to
what I am used to. I realize I am going to have reteach myself different tactics and approaches when using the language
that I might not use with Java or C++. I might not have as much control as with C++ for example, but from my current
impression situations where I am using javascript do not appear to need as precise levels of memory control.

##Goals##

I am hoping to learn how to better utilize the language and good design techniques, in order to be able to tackle a
variety of problems in the future. Ultimately my first impression still holds true for me at the moment, the language
feels familiar yet foreign, I am hoping to explore the quirks and features that it offers. I am greatful to be able to
add another language as popular as javascript to my toolbelt in order to tackle problems in the future. I am hoping to
be able to achieve this while exploring proper software design techniques and strategies that will allow me to create
high-quality products that I would be proud to place my name on.

## My Background in HTML and CSS

Prior to the current Spring 2021 semester I have had very little formal experience when it comes to UI design in html
and css. I might have had some experience messing around displaying text from an html file but I had never explored
further than that. Recently we began studying html and css to recreate UI designs of popular websites for learning 
purposes. At first it seemed fair straight-forward. I was able to display text to the page, I added margins, I changed
the colors of the elements on the page... Overall it felt like a very simple process. That was until I began attempting
to order the various items on the page in different layouts. As an example, creating columns seemed like something that
should be so simple yet required seemingly more work than I thought would be necessary.

## Looking Forward with UI Frameworks

With the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) framework I learned to appreciate the usefulness of a UI framework. After I had gained a
rudimentary grasp of html and css, creating good looking web pages using the Semantic UI framework felt like a breeze,
and there were so many tools to work with. I had a couple hiccups attempting to use the framework at first, but the 
excellent documentation and variety of examples made the learning process much easier, to the point where displaying
items on the page almost felt as if I was writting in English. Multiple column layouts seemed elementary: if I wanted
a grid layout I could just create a div class called "ui grid"; And of course if I wanted a column with rows I would
created a column and a row. It might not sound like something that is very exciting, but I was thrilled as to how 
a framework like Semantic UI made the UI development process simple and streamlined, and inspired me to further explore
its capabilities.

I am really enjoying learning the skills needed to build functional webpages with good aesthetics. I always enjoy 
programming challenges that allow me to express my artistic side and further my learning. I understand I have a lot 
more to learn when it comes to UI design concepts and building webpages with html, css, and their various UI 
frameworks, and I am excited to explore the field further. In the following weeks in ICS 314 we will be studying how to
use the React framework for UI design and I am looking forward to delving into the various things that can be
accomplished with it.

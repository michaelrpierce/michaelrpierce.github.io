## Overview

*The Problem*: During the pandemic social distancing has led to less student interaction outside the classroom than ever before. How do you promote peer-peer interaction outside of the classroom while ensuring everyone’s health and safety?

*The Solution*: A UH chat service akin to Omegle that randomly connects interested students in an online chat room. UH members can log into the chat service and connect with other members randomly or based on similar interests.

## Mockup page ideas

* Landing page
* Login page
* Sign up page
* Profile page
* “Start Chatting” page
  * Report function to report anyone 
  * Emojis :P
  * Option to chat as anonymous
* Topics page
* Report Page

## Use case ideas
* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, and sets up profile w/ profile pic, name, year, major, interests, and social media handles(optional)

* Members log in, visit the explore page and set chatting preferences (anonymous, interests, nickname, group chat vs 1 on 1, etc) before clicking “Start Chatting.” Members will then be brought to the Start Chatting page where they will be connected to other students using the service. The start chatting page includes a text chat, 

* If students feel unsafe or endangered during chatting they can click on the report button which will end the current chat and bring them to the report page. In the report page they will have the option to report any users from previous chat sessions. Members will also be able to block any further interactions with users on the site. The profile information of anonymous users will not be available to view on the report page but will be submitted along with any additional information added to the report form by the user.

* Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, views reports and takes actions based on submitted information.

## Beyond the basics
* Video chatting option with ability to apply special filters to the video.
* Topics page that shows the top live and overall trending topics on the platform
* Profanity filter that prevents users from inputting inappropriate words or topics as a nickname or topic idea
* Emoji support
* Built in games on the chatting page for members to play with each other.

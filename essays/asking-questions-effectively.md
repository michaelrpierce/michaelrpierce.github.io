## Introduction

Eric Raymond's [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) provides a helpful guideline when it comes to asking technical
questions. The introduction of the document provides an excellent insight into what kind of mindsight makes a question
good vs bad. The distinction between winners with well formulated, thought-provoking questions, and losers highlights
the important distinction between making progress and wasting the time of those around you. There many helpful tips 
to possibly even find the answers without requiring posting to a forum in the first place (such as through a google 
search or through previous posts on a specific forum). Taking the time to ponder your topic and actively engaging to
attempt the problem are likely to provide better/helpful results. Demanding someone else to solve a problem that you
have no interest in attempting does not improve your skills as a programmer, and will only serve to hinder you.

## Bad Example

The StackOverflow question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4434754/whats-wrong-with-this-code) provides an excellent example of how not taking a moment to develop your question
in a smart way can lead to inefficiencies and a waste of time for anyone involved. The OP (original poster) begins by describing
the problem they are having with reading files with a particular file name. If you feel like that is vague and
uninformative as to what problem the original poster is having, then you will not have any luck from visiting
the post for further detail. After that brief description, a snippet of code is posted followed by the question:
"Could anyone tell me where am i doing wrong!?". As you can probably imagine the comments on the post are only as
helpful as the post itself. There is constant back and forth between the OP and the commentors who are constantly
asking for more information or detail, or linking to external documentation, as OP does not provide enough detail
or effort into describing what they are attempting to do. It is not until you read to the very last comment on the
page that OP provides information that the project they are attempting to build is a spam filter, leading to an
unrelated answer and wasted time. After 2 edits it appears OP was never able to solve the issue they were having, 
as they posted more snippets of code without attempting to further communicate which parts of the problem they 
needed assistance with. It feels as if OP was asking for other members to solve their homework problem.

## Good Example

Now consider the most upvoted posted on StackOverflow [Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an
unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) The question provided here is an example of what constitutes a "smart question". For starters,
the OP of this question is not asking for anyone to tell them where they are doing wrong. The question title itself
provides a clear demonstration of the problem that OP is trying to accomplish. OP is clearly demonstrating in the post
that they are trying to understand why a segment of code runs faster on sorted data vs unsorted data and provides
examples of what they have attempted in order to understand the issue. As a result of OP taking the time to formulated
their question in a constructive manner, they receive productive answers. The top answer provides a well-formatted 
insight into both the concept behind OP's topic, and highlights which section of the code is causing the issue. 

By showing that they are committed to solving their problem, OP attracted the attention of others and inspired them
to work together to form a productive discussion. StackOverflow and other forums are not homework solving boards for
one to reference so that they can avoid thinking. The level of effort a poster puts into solving a problem is going
to be reciprocated by the commentors. If you don't want to take the time to think through your situation, why should
others? Put the effort into your research now so that you can save yourself from the hassle later.

#My Software Engineering Experience

##My First Encounter With Software Development.

I first learned that I had an interest in software engineering and code design when I was a student in highschool. As a
student enrolled in an IB program (International Baccalaureate), I was required to partake in a personal project, in
order to develop self-learning techniques. I have always been fascinated by computers and video games, and decided that
I would utilize this project to take my first steps into the world of programming. For my first ever experience with 
programming I decided I would attempt to recreate the simple windows calculator app that came with my computer, with 
just basic operations of addition, subtracting, division, and multiplication. (Ok maybe not my first experience, but 
editing an Adobe Flash file to make a ball bounce across the screen hardly counts as programming.)

##Over 3 Billion Errors

I had learned about the language from playing the popular videogame Minecraft and online forums seemed to agree that it
was a good first programming language; according to Oracle it even ran on almost '3 Billion devices'... I remember 
constructing the program to be difficult. As a sophomore in high school, I never had the opportunity to study
any programming or concept design concepts, and I definitely didn't understand why a semicolon was so important for 
something called "compiling". Eventually I stumbled my way through the Java documentation and was able to construct a 
JPanel with JButtons. I had no idea what I was doing, but it was exhilarating. I was able to (with copious amounts of 
online forum browsing) lay out a simple grid with with all the numbers and operators, and it actually calculated my 
result! It might have crashed after 5 minutes due to a memory leak, but I was still proud of my small accomplishment.

##Looking Forward

Though I have more experience now with steps to take when it comes to program design, I often think back to that first
calculator program. When programming I often end up back in that state of struggle and researching when my code doesn't
work, or if I run into issues. However, it is the process of learning and problem-solving that I enjoy most. It can be
incredibly frustrating at times, yet I often look forward to my next moment of struggle because I know that I will have
gained something new out of it. This is the outlook I intended to maintain as I grow as a ICS student. I am hoping to 
broaden my knowledge and be put into situations that allow me to become a more well-rounded software engineer.
